<h1>Creating Custom Brush Commands</h1>
<p>
Creating a new brush command is very easy.  There are
four simple steps.
<ol>
<li>Create a command file called COMMANDFILE.brush.inc

<li>Implement the function COMMANDFILE_brush_help(). Optional.

<li>Implement the function COMMANDFILE_brush_command()

<li>Implement the functions that your commands will call.
    These will usually be named brush_COMMANDFILE_COMMANDNAME().
</ol><p>
For an example brush command, see examples/sandwich.brush.inc.
The steps for implementing your command are explained in more
detail below.

<h2>Create COMMANDFILE.brush.inc</h2>
<p>
The name of your brush command is very important.  It must end
in ".brush.inc" to be recognized as a brush command.  The part
of the filename that comes before the ".brush.inc" becomes the
name of the commandfile.  Your commandfile name is used by
brush to compose the names of the functions it will call, so
choose wisely.
<p>
The example brush command, 'make-me-a-sandwich', is stored
in the 'sandwich' commandfile, 'sandwich.brush.inc'.
<p>
Brush searches for commandfiles in the following locations:
<ul>
<li>The "/path/to/brush/commands" folder.

<li>Folders listed in the 'include' option (see `brush topic docs-configuration`).

<li>The system-wide brush commands folder, e.g. /usr/share/brush/commands

<li>The ".brush" folder in the user's HOME folder.

<li>All modules in the current Backdrop installation

<li>Folders and files containing other versions of brush in their names will
be *skipped* (e.g. devel.drop4.inc or drop4/devel.brush.inc).  Names
containing the current version of brush (e.g. devel.drop5.inc) will be loaded.</li>
</ul> <p>
Note that modules in the current Backdrop installation will only
be considered if brush has bootstrapped to at least the BRUSH_BOOSTRAP_SITE
level.  Usually, when working with a Backdrop site, brush will
bootstrap to BRUSH_BOOTSTRAP_FULL; in this case, only the brush
commandfiles in enabled modules will be considered eligible for
loading.  If a brush only bootstraps to BRUSH_BOOTSTRAP_SITE,
though, then all brush commandfiles will be considered, whether the
module is enabled or not.  See `brush topic docs-bootstrap` for
more information on bootstrapping.
<p>
Additionally, brush commandfiles may optionally define a function
COMMANDFILE_brush_load() in the file COMMANDFILE.brush.load.inc.
If this function returns FALSE, then the commandfile will not be loaded.

<h2>Implement COMMANDFILE_brush_help()</h2>
<p>
The brush_help hook is an optional place to describe a command in long form. If
the command only requires a brief description, use the description key in
COMMANDFILE_brush_command(). The brush_help hook for the 'sandwich' commandfile looks
like this:
<pre>
        function sandwich_brush_help($section) {
          switch ($section) {
            case 'brush:make-me-a-sandwich':
              return dt("... brief help summary goes here ...");
          }
        }
</pre><p>
Note that the command name is prepended with 'brush:' in
the brush_help hook.  Your commandfile may implement
multiple commands; to do so, just add more 'case' statements
to the switch, one for each command.

<h2>Implement COMMANDFILE_brush_command()</h2>
<p>
The brush_command hook is the most important part of the
commandfile.  It returns an array of items that define
how your commands should be called, and how they work.
Brush commands are very similar to the Backdrop menu system.
The elements that can appear in a brush command definition
are shown below.
<ul>
<li>'aliases':

     Provides a list of shorter names for the command.
     For example, pm-download may also be called via `brush dl`.
     If the alias is used, brush will substitute back in the
     primary command name, so pm-download will still be used
     to generate the command hook, etc.

<li>'deprecated-aliases':

     Works just like 'aliases', but does not
     appear in help.  Used in instances where the brush
     maintainers intend to eventually remove support for a
     command alias.  If someone runs a brush command using a
     deprecated alias, brush will print a warning message.

<li>'command hook':

     Change the name of the function brush will
     call to execute the command from brush_COMMANDFILE_COMMANDNAME()
     to brush_COMMANDFILE_COMMANDHOOK(), where COMMANDNAME is the
     original name of the command, and COMMANDHOOK is the value
     of the 'command hook' item.

<li>'callback':

     Name of function to invoke for this command.  The callback
     function name _must_ begin with "brush_commandfile_", where commandfile
     is from the file "commandfile.brush.inc", which contains the
     commandfile_brush_command() function that returned this command.
     Note that the callback entry is optional; it is preferable to
     omit it, in which case brush_invoke() will generate the hook function name.

<li>'callback arguments':

     An array of arguments to pass to the callback.
     The command line arguments, if any, will appear after the
     callback arguments in the function parameters.

<li>'description':

     Description of the command.

<li>'arguments':

     An array of arguments that are understood by the command.
     Used by `brush help` only.

<li>'options':

     An array of options that are understood by the command.
     Used by `brush help` only.

<li>'examples':

     An array of examples that are understood by the command.
     Used by `brush help` only.

<li>'scope':

     One of 'system', 'project', 'site'.  Not currently used.

<li>'bootstrap':

     Backdrop bootstrap level.  Valid values are:
<ul>
      <li>BRUSH_BOOTSTRAP_BRUSH
      <li>BRUSH_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_ROOT
      <li>BRUSH_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_SITE
      <li>BRUSH_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_CONFIGURATION
      <li>BRUSH_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_DATABASE
      <li>BRUSH_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_FULL
      <li>BRUSH_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_LOGIN
      <li>BRUSH_BOOTSTRAP_MAX
</ul>
     The default value is BRUSH_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_LOGIN.

     See `brush topic docs-bootstrap`.

<li>'core':

     Backdrop major version required. Append a '+' to indicate 'and later versions.'

<li>'backdrop dependencies':

     Backdrop modules required for this command.

<li>'brush dependencies':

     Other brush commandfiles required for this command.

 <li>'topics':

     Provides a list of topic commands that are related in
     some way to this command.  Used by `brush help` only.

<li>'topic':

     Set to TRUE if this command is a topic, callable from the
     `brush docs-topics` command.
</ul><p>
The 'sandwich' brush_command hook looks like this:
<pre>
        function sandwich_brush_command() {
          $items = array();

          $items['make-me-a-sandwich'] = array(
            'description' => "Makes a delicious sandwich.",
            'arguments' => array(
              'filling' => 'The type of the sandwich (turkey, cheese, etc.)',
            ),
            'options' => array(
              'spreads' => 'Comma delimited list of spreads (e.g. mayonnaise, mustard)',
            ),
            'examples' => array(
              'brush mmas turkey --spreads=ketchup,mustard' => 'Make a terrible-tasting sandwich that is lacking in pickles.',
            ),
            'aliases' => array('mmas'),
            'bootstrap' => BRUSH_BOOTSTRAP_BRUSH, // No bootstrap at all.
          );

          return $items;
        }
</pre><p>
Most of the items in the 'make-me-a-sandwich' command
definition have no effect on execution, and are used only
by `brush help`.  The exceptions are 'aliases' (described
above) and 'bootstrap'.  As previously mentioned,
`brush topic docs-bootstrap` explains the brush bootstrapping
process in detail.

<h2>Implement brush_COMMANDFILE_COMMANDNAME()</h2>
<p>
The 'make-me-a-sandwich' command in sandwich.brush.inc
is defined as follows:
<pre>
	function brush_sandwich_make_me_a_sandwich($filling = 'ascii') {
	  ... implementation here ...
        }
</pre><p>
If a user runs `brush make-me-a-sandwich` with no command line
arguments, then brush will call brush_sandwich_make_me_a_sandwich()
with no function parameters; in this case, $filling will take on
the provided default value, 'ascii'.  (If there is no default
value provided, then the variable will be NULL, and a warning
will be printed.)  Running `brush make-me-a-sandwich ham` will
cause brush to call brush_sandwich_make_me_a_sandwich('ham').  In
the same way, commands that take two command line arguments can
simply define two functional parameters, and a command that takes
a variable number of command line arguments can use the standard
php function func_get_args() to get them all in an array for easy
processing.
<p>
Note that brush will actually call a sequence of functions before
and after your brush command function.  One of these hooks is the
"validate" hook.  The 'sandwich' commandfile provides a validate
hook for the 'make-me-a-sandwich' command:
<pre>
        function brush_sandwich_make_me_a_sandwich_validate() {
          $name = posix_getpwuid(posix_geteuid());
          if ($name['name'] !== 'root') {
            return brush_set_error('MAKE_IT_YOUSELF', dt('What? Make your own sandwich.'));
          }
        }
</pre><p>
The validate function should call brush_set_error and return
its result if the command cannot be validated for some reason.
See `brush topic docs-policy` for more information on defining
policy functions with validate hooks, and `brush topic docs-api`
for information on how the command hook process works.  Also,
the list of defined brush error codes can be found in
`brush topic docs-errorcodes`.
