<h1>The Drop Bootstrap Process</h1>
<p>
When preparing to run a command, drop works by "bootstrapping" 
the Backdrop environment in very much the same way that is done 
during a normal page request from the web server, so most drop 
commands run in the context of a fully-initialized website.
<p>
For efficiency and convenience, some drop commands can work
without first bootstrapping a Backdrop site, or by only partially
bootstrapping a site.  This is more efficient, because there is
sometimes a slight delay involved with bootstrapping, especially
in some of the later stages.  It is also a matter of convenience,
because some commands are useful to use even when you do not
have a working Backdrop site available to bootstrap.  For example,
you can use drop to download Backdrop with `drop dl backdrop`.  This
obviously does not require any bootstrapping to work.
<p>
The drop bootstrapping process is also very closely related with
drop configuration files.  At each bootstrap phase, drop may load
additional configuration files that may contain additional drop
settings.  This has two very important connotations.  First, settings
that are only loaded in a later bootstrap phase are not available
for commands that do not reach that bootstrap phase.  Second, it
is possible to alter drop behavior on a per-site basis by applying
settings in a site-specific configuration file.  See 
`drop topic docs-configuration` for details on drop configuration
files.

<h2>DROP_BOOTSTRAP_DROP</h2>
<p>
Configuration files loaded during this phase:<ul>
<li>Drop installation folder.
<li>System wide configuration folder (e.g. /etc/drop/droprc.php).
<li>User's .drop folder (i.e. ~/.drop/droprc.php).
<li>In any location, as specified by the --config (-c) option.
</ul><p>
Only bootstrap Drop, without any Backdrop specific code.
<p>
Any code that operates on the Drop installation, and not specifically
any Backdrop directory, should bootstrap to this phase.


<h2>DROP_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_ROOT</h2>
<p>
Configuration files loaded during this phase:<ul>
<li>Backdrop installation root.
</ul><p>
Set up and test for a valid backdrop root, either through the -r/--root options,
or evaluated based on the current working directory.
<p>
Any code that interacts with an entire Backdrop installation, and not a specific
site on the Backdrop installation should use this bootstrap phase.


<h2>DROP_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_SITE</h2>
<p>
Configuration files loaded during this phase:<ul>
<li>Backdrop site folder (e.g sites/{default|example.com}/droprc.php).
</ul><p>
Set up a Backdrop site directory and the correct environment variables to
allow Backdrop to find the configuration file.
<p>
If no site is specified with the -l / --uri options, Drop will assume the
site is 'default', which mimics Backdrop's behaviour.
<p>
If you want to avoid this behaviour, it is recommended that you use the
DROP_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_ROOT bootstrap phase instead.
<p>
Any code that needs to modify or interact with a specific Backdrop site's
settings.php file should bootstrap to this phase.


<h2>DROP_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_CONFIGURATION</h2>
<p>
Load the settings from the Backdrop sites directory.
<p>
This phase is analagous to the BACKDROP_BOOTSTRAP_CONFIGURATION bootstrap phase in Backdrop
itself, and this is also the first step where Backdrop specific code is included.
<p>
This phase is commonly used for code that interacts with the Backdrop install API,
as both install.php and update.php start at this phase.


<h2>DROP_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_DATABASE</h2>
<p>
Connect to the Backdrop database using the database credentials loaded
during the previous bootstrap phase.
<p>
This phase is analogous to the BACKDROP_BOOTSTRAP_DATABASE bootstrap phase in
Backdrop.
<p>
Any code that needs to interact with the Backdrop database API needs to
be bootstrapped to at least this phase.


<h2>DROP_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_FULL</h2>
<p>
Fully initialize Backdrop.
<p>
This is the default bootstrap phase all commands will try to reach,
unless otherwise specified.
This is analogous to the BACKDROP_BOOTSTRAP_FULL bootstrap phase in
Backdrop.
<p>
Any code that interacts with the general Backdrop API should be
bootstrapped to this phase.


<h2>DROP_BOOTSTRAP_BACKDROP_LOGIN</h2>
<p>
Log in to the initialiased Backdrop site.
<p>
This bootstrap phase is used after the site has been
fully bootstrapped.
<p>
This phase will log you in to the backdrop site with the username
or user ID specified by the --user/ -u option.
<p>
Use this bootstrap phase for your command if you need to have access
to information for a specific user, such as listing nodes that might
be different based on who is logged in.


<h2>DROP_BOOTSTRAP_MAX</h2>
<p>
This is not an actual bootstrap phase.  Commands that use
DROP_BOOTSTRAP_MAX will cause drop to bootstrap as far
as possible, and then run the command regardless of the
bootstrap phase that was reached.  This is useful for drop
commands that work without a bootstrapped site, but that
provide additional information or capabilities in the presence
of a bootstrapped site.  For example, `drop pm-releases modulename`
works without a bootstrapped Backdrop site, but will include
the version number for the installed module if a Backdrop site
has been bootstrapped.
